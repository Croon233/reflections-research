A Study of Big-Data-Driven Data Visualization and Visual Communication Design Patterns:https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2021/6704937/

This paper delves into the comprehensive study and analysis of data visualization and visual communication design models driven by big data. It examines the characteristics of new 
media, contrasts them with traditional media, and underscores the significance of the new media landscape through comparison. Additionally, it analyzes contemporary successful cases
of new media integration. The study aims to optimize the conventional science and technology intelligence service model by enhancing various components constituting the science and 
technology intelligence wisdom service. Through model optimization, it reflects four key characteristics of science and technology intelligence wisdom service, employing a 
literature research method. The design, rooted in imagery schema theory, is not only manifest and inclusive but also somewhat innovative, maintaining a high degree of consistency 
and internal logical relationship with the cognitive level's visual representation of multidomain heterogeneous data and their intended purpose. This internal logical relationship 
is systematically organized and deeply analyzed, proposing a methodology ranging from subpattern extraction and visual interaction design to the profound integration of visual 
representation, in conjunction with specific application scenarios and cases.
