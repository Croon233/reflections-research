This paper addresses the widening digital divide, particularly in rural African communities, where access to digital technology remains limited. It highlights disparities in 
internet access between urban and rural areas, emphasizing the reliance on mobile phones for internet connectivity in rural regions. The study focuses on Eastern Cape schools in 
South Africa, proposing a participatory design approach to develop a digital education portal involving learners, teachers, and key stakeholders. Results indicate stakeholders'
willingness to engage and contribute to such platforms, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and inclusivity in design to ensure accessibility and usability for all users.
