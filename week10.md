
From Static to Interactive: Transforming Data Visualization to Improve Transparencyï¼šhttps://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002484

This paper explores the potential of interactive graphics to revolutionize scientific publications by offering dynamic datasets guided by authors, enhancing transparency and 
reproducibility. Focusing on small sample size studies, it introduces an interactive line graph as an alternative to static representations, aiming to encourage wider adoption
of interactive graphics and meet the increasing need for detailed data presentation.
