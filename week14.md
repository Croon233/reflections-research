Over the last decade, India has witnessed a surge in urban population and migration to major cities, necessitating efficient civic management. The Smart City mission by the 
Government of India prioritizes the development of Intelligent Public Transport Systems, with many cities implementing Integrated Command and Control Centers for data-driven
