Why Combining Text and Visualization Could Improve Bayesian Reasoning: A Cognitive Load Perspective https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3544548.3581218

The paper explores how different presentation formats affect cognitive load when solving Bayesian problems. It compares text-only, visualization-only, and combined text and 
visualization formats. Findings indicate that visualization reduces cognitive demand, especially for individuals with low working memory capacity. This suggests that combining 
text and visualization can enhance Bayesian reasoning accuracy while minimizing cognitive load.
